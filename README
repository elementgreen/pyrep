Search and/or replace regular expressions within many files interactively.

pyrep (*Py*thon g*rep*) is a python script with which you can search
and also replace regular expressions in a collection of files.
Its functionality is similar to the perl script plrep from mv_perl.

To install this script, just copy it into your $PATH.

For Gentoo, there is an ebuild in the mv overlay (available by layman).
